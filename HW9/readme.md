#Cybersecurity  

    Mission 1
Issue: Due to the DoS attack, the Empire took down the Resistance's DNS and primary email servers.
•	The Resistance's network team was able to build and deploy a new DNS server and mail server.
•	The new primary mail server is asltx.l.google.com and the secondary should be asltx.2.google.com.
•	The Resistance (starwars.com) is able to send emails but unable to receive any.
Your mission:
•	Determine and document the mail servers for starwars.com using NSLOOKUP.
